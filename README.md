# Housing_Data_Cleaning
A Cleaning of messy housing data using SQL

I give you permission to use this code in whatever way you desire.

The goal of this project is to apply data cleaning skills to a somewhat messy dataset.
Methods of doing this were populating null fields, partitioning the address columns into individual fields
such as street, city, and state. And getting rid of any duplicates.
